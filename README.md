Project Documentation: CodeGen Assistant : Python Code Generator and Analyzer


1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
The CodeGen Assistant : Python Code Generator and Analyzer is designed to simplify software development tasks by automating code generation, debugging, and comment generation. This system leverages advanced machine learning models to assist developers in writing cleaner, more efficient code.
1.2 Objectives
•	Automate code generation based on user requirements.
•	Identify and fix syntax and logical errors in code.
•	Generate meaningful comments for existing codebases.
•	Support python programming languages.
1.3 Scope
The system will provide functionalities for:
•	Generating code snippets or modules.
•	Debugging code for errors.
•	Commenting existing code effectively.

2. Requirements
2.1 Functional Requirements
•	User can input prompts for code generation.
•	System can identify and highlight errors in code.
•	User can request automatic code comments.
2.3 Technical Requirements
•	Programming Languages: Python
•	Frameworks:  PyTorch, Flask
•	Deployment:  HuggingFace  (transformers)
3. System Architecture
•	Frontend: User Interface (UI) for input and output visualization.
•	Backend: API handling and model integration.
•	Model Engine: Pre-trained AI/ML models for code generation, debugging, and commenting.

4. Data Collection and Preprocessing
•	Source code from open-source repositories (GitHub, GitLab).
•	Dataset cleaning and preprocessing (e.g., removing duplicates, normalizing syntax)..

5. Model Selection and Training
•	Models Used: GPT-based models, Transformer architectures.
•	Training Objectives:
o	Minimize token prediction loss (Code Generation).
o	Maximize error detection accuracy (Debugging).
o	Improve semantic clarity (Commenting).
Conclusion
The Code Automation System aims to reduce work by automating repetitive tasks, improving productivity, and reducing human error.
